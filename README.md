# Data Analytics Assignment - 4 Questions Project

## Project Overview

This project consists of solving four distinct data analytics questions, each focusing on different aspects of data visualization, random number generation, and performance analysis using Python. The assignment is designed to demonstrate proficiency in basic Python programming, data manipulation, and visualization techniques, using libraries like `matplotlib` and built-in Python functions.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to apply Python and its data analysis libraries to solve various tasks related to character frequency analysis, random number visualization, and performance measurement. Each question focuses on different aspects of data handling and visualization, aimed at providing a comprehensive learning experience.

## Project Structure

The project contains:

- **`pyplot.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook implementing the solutions for the four questions.
- **`pyplot.html`**: An exported HTML file showcasing visualizations from the project.
- **`README.md`**: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Questions Breakdown

### 1. Character Frequency Distribution (Bar Plot)
- **Objective**: Create a bar plot showing the frequency distribution of characters in a given text string. 
- **Skills**: Text processing, using Python's `collections.Counter` and `matplotlib` for visualizations.
- **Output**: A bar chart displaying the frequency of each character in the provided text.

### 2. Visualizing Random Numbers (Scatter and Plot)
- **Objective**: Generate a sequence of random integers and visualize them using both a scatter plot and a line plot.
- **Skills**: Random number generation using Pythonâ€™s `random` library, data visualization using `matplotlib`.
- **Output**: Two separate plots (scatter plot and line plot) of random numbers.

### 3. Visualizing Random Numbers with Custom Style
- **Objective**: Repeat the second question, but customize the style and color of the scatter and line plots.
- **Skills**: Customizing visualizations with `matplotlib`, including styles and colors.
- **Output**: Enhanced scatter and line plots with custom colors and styles.

### 4. Sorting Algorithm Performance (Scatter Plot)
- **Objective**: Plot the execution time of two sorting algorithms (Insertion Sort and Merge Sort) against the size of the list sorted.
- **Skills**: Data plotting, performance analysis, understanding sorting algorithms.
- **Output**: A scatter plot comparing the execution times of both algorithms for various list sizes.
